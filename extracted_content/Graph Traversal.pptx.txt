Graph Traversal
Graph traversal (also known as graph search) refers to
the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each
vertex in a graph. Such traversals are classified by the
order in which the vertices are visited

Depth First Search - DFS
A depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing
a finite graph. DFS visits the child vertices before
visiting the sibling vertices; that is, it traverses the depth
of any particular path before exploring its breadth. A
stack (often the program's call stack via recursion) is
generally used when implementing the algorithm.

Traversal Order
• A preordering is a list of the vertices in the order
that they were first visited by the depth-first search
algorithm.
– E.g. A B D C / A C D B
• A postordering is a list of the vertices in the order
that they were last visited by the algorithm.
– E.g. D B C A / D C B A
• A reverse postordering is the reverse of a
postordering, i.e. a list of the vertices in the opposite
order of their last visit. Reverse postordering is not
the same as preordering.
– E.g A C B D / A B C D

Breath First Search
A breadth-first search (BFS) is another technique for
traversing a finite graph. BFS visits the sibling vertices
before visiting the child vertices
A queue is used in the search process. This algorithm is
often used to find the shortest path from one vertex to
another.

Complexity
• O(V+E)
• Each vertex is only visited once due to the fact that DFS
will only recursively explore a vertex u if status[u] =
unvisited — O(V)
• Every time a vertex is visited, all its k neighbors are
explored and therefore after all vertices are visited, we
have examined all E edges — (O(E) as the total number
of neighbors of each vertex equals to E).

Backtracking
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some)
solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint
satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the
solutions, and abandons each partial candidate c ("backtracks") as
soon as it determines that c cannot possibly be completed to a valid
solution.
