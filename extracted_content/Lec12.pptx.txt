Simple Graph
Definition 1. A simple graph G = (V, E)
consists of V, a nonempty set of vertices,
and E, a set of unordered pairs of distinct
elements of V called edges.
A simple graph is an undirected graph.

Weighted Graph
In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or cost
▪ Usually, the edge weights are nonnegative integers.
▪ Some graphs allow negative weights

Adjacent Vertices (Neighbors)
Definition 1. Two vertices, u and v in an undirected
graph G are called adjacent (or neighbors) in G, if
{u, v} is an edge of G.
An edge e connecting u and v is called incident with
vertices u and v, or is said to connect u and v. The
vertices u and v are called endpoints of edge {u, v}.

Graph Terminology
An undirected graph has an even number of vertices

of odd degree.
Let V1 and V2 be the set of vertices of even and odd

degrees, respectively (Thus V1 ∩ V2 = ∅, and V1
∪V2 = V).
Then by Handshaking theorem

2|E| = ∑ deg(v) = ∑ deg(v) + ∑ deg(v)

v∈V v∈V1 v∈V2
Since both 2|E| and ∑ deg(v) are even,

v∈V1
∑ deg(v) must be even.

Since deg(v) if odd for all v∈V2, |V2| must be even.

Definition: A simple graph is called bipartite if its
vertex set V can be partitioned into two disjoint
nonempty sets V and V such that every edge in the

graph connects a vertex in V with a vertex in V (so

that no edge in G connects either two vertices in V or
1
two vertices in V ).

For example, consider a graph that represents
each person in a village by a vertex and each
marriage by an edge.
This graph is bipartite, because each edge connects a
vertex in the subset of males with a vertex in the
subset of females (if we think of traditional
72
marriages).

Hamilton paths and cycles (cont.)
No property is known to efficiently verify existence of a Hamilton
cycle/path for general graphs.Moreover, the problem is known to be
as difficult as the TSP (find the shortest H. cycle through n cities).
Dirac’s Theorem: If G is a simple graph with n ≥ 3 vertices such that
the degree of every vertex is at least n/2, then G has a Hamilton
cycle.
Ore’s Theorem: If G is a simple graph with n ≥ 3 vertices such that
the deg(u) + deg(v) n for every pair of nonadjacent vertices u and
≥
v, then G has a Hamilton cycle.
Ore’s condition is more general than Dirac’s but neither is
necessary for existence of a Hamilton cycle.

Every plane graph has exactly one unbounded region,
called the exterior region (outer face). The vertices and

Graph Coloring
A coloring of the vertices of a graph G is an assignment of colors to
the vertices. A coloring is proper if adjacentvertices always have
different colors. This is also called the vertex coloring problem
An m-coloring of G is a mapping from V onto the set
{1,2,...,m} of m “colors”
Graph coloring includes:
• Vertex coloring
• Edge coloring
• Face coloring
