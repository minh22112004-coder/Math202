Internal Vertex
A vertex that has children is called an
internal vertex.
The subtree at vertex v is the subgraph of
the tree consisting of vertex v and its
descendants and all edges incident to
those descendants.

Binary Tree
Definition 2’. A rooted tree is called a
binary tree if every internal vertex has
no more than 2 children.
The tree is called a full binary tree if
every internal vertex has exactly 2
children.
24

=== Trang 25 ===
Ordered Binary Tree
Definition 2’’. An ordered rooted tree is a
rooted tree where the children of each
internal vertex are ordered.
In an ordered binary tree, the two
possible children of a vertex are called
the left child and the right child, if they
exist.
25

=== Trang 26 ===
Tree Properties
Theorem 2. A tree with N vertices has N-1
edges.
H
Theorem 5. There are at most 2 leaves in a
binary tree of height H.
Corallary. If a binary tree with L leaves is
full and balanced, then its height is
H = (cid:170) log L (cid:186) .

Searching takes time . . .
So the goal in computer programs is to find
any stored item efficiently when all stored
items are ordered.
A Binary Search Tree can be used to store
items in its vertices. It enables efficient
searches.
42

=== Trang 43 ===
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is . . .
A special kind of binary tree in which:
1. Each vertex contains a distinct key value,
2. The key values in the tree can be compared using
“greater than” and “less than”, and
3. The key value of each vertex in the tree is
less than every key value in its right subtree, and
greater than every key value in its left subtree.

=== Trang 44 ===
Shape of a binary search tree . . .
Depends on its key values and their order of insertion.
Insert the elements ‘J’ ‘E’ ‘F’ ‘T’ ‘A’ in that order.
The first value to be inserted is put into the root.
‘J’
44

=== Trang 45 ===
Inserting ‘E’ into the BST
Thereafter, each value to be inserted begins by
comparing itself to the value in the root, moving left
it is less, or moving right if it is greater. This
continues at each level until it can be inserted as a
new leaf.

‘E’

=== Trang 46 ===

Traversal Algorithms
A traversal algorithm is a procedure for
(cid:122)
systematically visiting every vertex of
an ordered binary tree.
Tree traversals are defined recursively.
(cid:122)
Three traversals are named:
(cid:122)
preorder,
inorder,
postorder.
53

=== Trang 54 ===
PREORDER Traversal Algorithm
Let T be an ordered binary tree with root r.
If T has only r, then r is the preorder traversal.
Otherwise, suppose T , T are the left and
1 2
right subtrees at r. The preorder traversal
begins by visiting r. Then traverses T in
1
preorder, then traverses T in preorder.

INORDER Traversal Algorithm
Let T be an ordered binary tree with root r.
If T has only r, then r is the inorder traversal.
Otherwise, suppose T , T are the left and
1 2
right subtrees at r. The inorder traversal
begins by traversing T in inorder. Then
1
visits r, then traverses T in inorder.

POSTORDER Traversal Algorithm
Let T be an ordered binary tree with root r.
If T has only r, then r is the postorder traversal.
Otherwise, suppose T , T are the left and right
1 2
subtrees at r. The postorder traversal begins
by traversing T in postorder. Then traverses
1
T in postorder, then ends by visiting r.

A Binary Expression Tree is . . .
A special kind of binary tree in which:
1. Each leaf node contains a single operand,
2. Each nonleaf node contains a single binary
operator, and
3. The left and right subtrees of an operator
node represent subexpressions that must
be evaluated before applying the operator at
the root of the subtree.

=== Trang 65 ===
Levels Indicate Precedence
When a binary expression tree is used to
represent an expression, the levels of the
nodes in the tree indicate their relative
precedence of evaluation.
Operations at higher levels of the tree are
evaluated later than those below them.
The operation at the root is always the
last operation performed.
